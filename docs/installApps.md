## InstallApps task
---
The `installApps` task copies applications generated by the Gradle project to the Liberty server's `dropins` or `apps` directory. Unlike the [deploy](deploy.md#deploy-task) task, `installApps` performs a simple copy operation. It does not require the server to be running and does not check if the application was successfully deployed.

### Parameters

See the [Liberty server configuration](libertyExtensions.md#liberty-server-configuration) properties for common server configuration.

In particular, the `apps`, `dropins`, `stripVersion`, and `looseApplication` properties are used for application installation.

If you target an application to the `dropins` folder, no configuration is needed to get the server to start the application. When you want to configure an application in server.xml, the `location` is relative to the `apps` folder. Applications in the `apps` folder are not started without configuration. If you configure an application to install to the `apps` folder and it is not configured, default configuration is created in the `configDropins` folder.

### Example:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'liberty'
apply plugin: 'war'

liberty {
    server {
        name = 'myServer'
        apps = [file('libertyApp.war')]
        dropins = [war]
        stripVersion = true
    }
}
```
