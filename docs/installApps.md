#### install-apps
---
Copy applications generated by the Gradle project to a Liberty server's `dropins` or `apps` directory. Unlike the [deploy](deploy.md#deploy) goal, this goal only performs a simple copy operation. It does not require the server to be running and does not check if the application was successfully deployed. 

###### Additional Parameters

The following are the parameters supported by this goal in addition to the [common parameters](common-parameters.md#common-parameters).

| Parameter | Type | Description | Required |
| --------  | ---- | ----------- | -------  |
| appsDirectory | String | The server's `apps` or `dropins` directory where the application files should be copied. The default value is set to `apps` if the application is defined in the server configuration, otherwise it is set to `dropins`.  | No |

##### Example: 

```groovy
apply plugin: 'liberty'

liberty {
    installapps{
        appsDirectory = 'dropins'
    }
} 
```
