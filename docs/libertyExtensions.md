## Liberty extension properties
The Liberty Gradle plugin defines properties in the `liberty` block to customize task behavior.
These properties are divided in two groups:
* The [general runtime properties](#general-runtime-properties) which control how the runtime is installed with the `installLiberty` task.
* The [Liberty server configuration](#liberty-server-configuration) properties control how a server is initialized and the applications that are installed. These properties are defined in a `server` block within the `liberty` block.

The [installLiberty](installLiberty.md), [compileJSP](compileJsp.md) and [libertyDevc](libertyDev.md#libertydevc-task-container-mode) tasks can be configured with their related extension inside the `liberty` block.

The [deploy](deploy.md), [undeploy](undeploy.md), [libertyPackage](libertyPackage.md), [installFeature](installFeature.md), [uninstallFeature](uninstallFeature.md), [cleanDirs](clean.md), [libertyDump](libertyDump.md), and [libertyJavaDump](libertyJavaDump.md) tasks can be configured with their related extension inside the `server` block.

### General runtime properties

| Attribute | Type | Since | Description | Required |
| --------- | ---- | ----- | ----------- | ---------|
| baseDir | String | 3.0 | The base installation directory. The actual installation directory of WebSphere Liberty server will be `${baseDir}/wlp`. The default value is `${project.buildDir}`. This was moved from the properties in the `install` block in version 3.0.| No |
| cacheDir | String | 3.0 | The directory used for caching downloaded files such as the license or `.jar` files. The default value is `${java.io.tmpdir}/wlp-cache`. This was moved from the properties in the `install` block in version 3.0.| No |
| installDir | String | 1.0 | Path to the WebSphere Liberty server installation `wlp` directory. To use a pre-installed version of Liberty, set this property to the path of the Liberty `wlp` directory, including `wlp` in the path. Additionally, `installDir` can be specified in the `gradle.properties` file or from the [command line](installLiberty.md#override-installDir). | No |
| outputDir | String | 1.0 | Deprecated. Value of the `${wlp_output_dir}` variable. The default value is `${installDir}/usr/servers/${serverName}`. This parameter has moved to the `server` block. | No |
| runtime | Properties | 3.0 | For overriding the `group`, `name` or `version` of the `libertyRuntime` installed from The Central Repository. The default runtime artifact is the latest version of `io.openliberty:openliberty-kernel`.
| userDir | String | 1.0 | Value of the `${wlp_user_dir}` variable. The default value is `${installDir}/usr/`. | No |

### Liberty server configuration

The `server` extension allows you to configure all the characteristics of a particular named server including configuration files, applications to install, and server specific properties and variables. To configure the server, add the `server` block to the `liberty` block in your build.gradle file. 

The following properties are supported for server configuration.

### Server extension properties

| Attribute | Type  | Since | Description | Required |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----------- | -------- |
| apps | List | 2.0 | List of `war` and `ear` task objects used to create applications to copy to the `apps` folder. If no `apps` or `dropins` are configured and this project applies the `war` or `ear` plugin, the default application is installed using the `deploy` task. If the application is not configured in the server.xml file, application configuration is added to the `configDropins` folder. | No |
| dropins | List | 2.0 | List of `war` or `ear` objects used to create applications to copy to the `dropins` folder. | No |
| bootstrapProperties| Properties | 3.0 | Inline bootstrap `Properties` that are written to the bootstrap.properties file in the server directory. These properties take precedence over a specified bootstrap.properties file. This was changed from a `Map` to a `Properties` object in 3.0.| No|
| bootstrapPropertiesFile| File | 2.0 | Location of the file containing server properties to copy to the bootstrap.properties file in the server instance.| No |
| clean | boolean | 1.0 | Clean all cached information on server start up. It deletes every file in the `${wlp_output_dir}/logs`, `${wlp_output_dir}/workarea`, `${wlp_user_dir}/dropins` or `${wlp_user_dir}/apps`. The default value is `false`. Only used with the `libertyStart` and `libertyRun` tasks. | No |
| configDirectory| File | 2.0 | Location of a server configuration directory to be used by the server instance. Configuration files and folder structure will be copied to the server instance. Files specified by other server extension properties will take precedence over files located in the configDirectory. The default value is `/src/main/liberty/config`. | No|
| defaultVar | Properties | 3.0 | Inline server variables that are written to the `configDropins/defaults/liberty-plugin-variable-config.xml` file in the server directory. The property name is used for the variable `name`, and the property value is used for the variable `defaultValue`.| No|
| embedded | boolean | 2.7 | Whether the server is [embedded](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSD28V_9.0.0/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.core.doc/ae/twlp_extend_embed.html) in the Gradle JVM. If not, the server will run as a separate process. The default value is `false`. Only used with the `libertyStart`, `libertyRun` and `libertyStop` tasks.| No |
| env | Properties | 3.0 | Inline server environment variables that are written to the server.env file in the server directory. These properties take precedence over a specified server.env file.| No|
| jvmOptions| List | 2.0 | Inline `List` of jvm options that is written to the jvm.options file in the server directory. These properties take precedence over a specified jvm.options file.| No|
| jvmOptionsFile| File | 2.0 | Location of the file containing JVM options to copy to the jvm.options file in the server instance.| No|
| looseApplication | boolean | 2.0 | Indicates to install application using loose application configuration so that war or ear files do not need to be regenerated for every application update. The loose application support for ear files requires Gradle 4.0 or higher.  The default is `true`. | No |
| mergeServerEnv | boolean | 3.1-M1 | Merge the server environment properties from all specified sources with the default generated `server.env` file in the target server. Conflicts are resolved with the same precedence as the replacement policy when this attribute is set to `false`. The properties specified in the `env` attribute are highest precedence, followed by the `serverEnvFile` attribute, then the `server.env` file located in the `configDirectory`, and finally the default generated `server.env` file in the target server. The default value is `false`. | No |
| name | String | 2.0 | The name of the server instance to create. The default value is `defaultServer`. | No |
| noPassword | boolean | 2.7 | Disable generation of the default keystore password by specifying the --no-password option when creating a new server. This option was added in 18.0.0.3. The default value is `false`. Only used with the `libertyCreate` task. | No |

| serverEnvFile | File | 3.0 | Location of the file containing server environment variables to copy to the server.env file in the server instance. This replaces the serverEnv property.| No |
| serverXmlFile | File | 3.0 | Location of the `server.xml` file used by the server instance. This replaces the configFile parameter.| No|
| stripVersion | boolean | 2.0 | Remove the artifact version when copying the application to Liberty runtime's application directory. The default value is false.  | No |

| var | Properties | 3.0 | Inline server variables that are written to the `configDropins/overrides/liberty-plugin-variable-config.xml` file in the server directory. The property name is used for the variable `name`, and the property value is used for the variable `value`.| No|
| verifyAppStartTimeout | int | 2.0 | Wait time for checking message logs for start of all applications installed with the `deploy` task. Only used with the `libertyStart` task. Default value is 0 seconds with no verification. | No |
