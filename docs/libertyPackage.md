This example shows you how to configure these properties in your script:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'liberty'

liberty {
    installDir = 'c:/wlp'
    serverName = 'myServer'
    userDir = 'c:/usr'
    outputDir = 'c:/usr'
    clean = true
    timeout = "10000"

    packageLiberty {
        archive = "MyServerPackage.zip"
        include = "usr"
    }
    
    //Example to package with 'os' parameter
    packageLiberty {
        archive = "MyServerPackage.zip"
        include = "minify"
        os = "Linux"
    }
}

```
