## undeploy task

The `undeploy` task supports undeployment of one or more applications from the WebSphere Liberty server.

### dependsOn
`undeploy` depends on `libertyStart` for a running server. 

### Properties

See the [Liberty server configuration](libertyExtensions.md#liberty-server-configuration) properties for common server configuration.

The `undeploy` task uses an `undeploy` block within the `server` block to define task specific behavior.

| Attribute | Type  | Since | Description | Required |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----------- | -------- |
| apps | Object[] | 3.0 | Specifies which tasks/files should be undeployed from the `apps` directory. Applications can be passed in as the task that generates the file or as an application file. | Yes - if `dropins` is not specified. |
| dropins | Object[] | 3.0 | Specifies which tasks/files should be undeployed from the `dropins` directory. Applications can be passed in as the task that generates the file or as an application file. | Yes - if `apps` is not specified. |

### Examples

1. Undeploys a single application file.
  ```groovy
    apply plugin: 'liberty'

    liberty {

        server {
            name = 'myServer'

            undeploy {
                apps = [file('app.war')]
            }
        }
    }
  ```

2. Undeploy multiple applications. Specifically, undeploy `sample.war` and the application generated by the `war` task from `apps`, and `test-war.war` from `dropins`.
  ```groovy
    apply plugin: 'liberty'
    apply plugin: 'war'

    liberty {
        server {
            name = 'myServer'

            undeploy {
                apps = [war, file('sample.war')]
                dropins = [file('test-war.war')]
            }
        }
    }
  ```

If no property is set for the `undeploy` block, nothing will be undeployed. A value must be provided to undeploy an application.
