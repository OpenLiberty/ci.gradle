## Build

Clone this repository and then, with a JRE on the path, execute the following command in the root directory.

```bash
$ ./gradlew build
```

This will download Gradle, build the plugin, and install it in to the `build\libs` directory. It is also possible to install the plugin in to your local Maven repository using `./gradlew install`.

To build the plugin and run the integration tests execute the following commands in the root directory. The `runtime` and `runtimeVersion` parameters are used to select the Liberty runtime that will be used to run the tests. The `wlpLicense` parameter is only needed for Liberty packaged as a JAR file.

 ```bash
 $ ./gradlew install check -Druntime=<wlp|ol> -DruntimeVersion=<runtime_version> -DwlpLicense=<liberty_license_code>
 ```

If you are writing any code affecting [libertyDevc](docs/libertyDev.md#libertydevc-task-container-mode) task, please be aware that the DevContainerTests are not run as part of the automated tests during the GitHub Actions (GHA) builds. Therefore, it is crucial to run these tests locally to ensure your changes are working correctly.

To run DevContainerTests locally, you must have either Podman or Docker set up and available on your system. Once your containerization tool is ready, you can execute the tests using the command provided below.

 ```bash
 $ ./gradlew install check -P"test.include"="**/DevContainerTest*" -Druntime=<wlp|ol> -DruntimeVersion=<runtime_version> -DwlpLicense=<liberty_license_code>
 ```

## Usage

### Compatibility / Support

For the full Java and Gradle version compatibility matrix, see the [Gradle Compatibility Matrix](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html).

- **Gradle 9.x** requires Java 17 or later and plugin version **3.9.4** or later.
- **Gradle 7.6 / 8.x** works with Java 8, 11, 17, or 21 and plugin version **3.8.2** or later.

For Liberty Gradle Plugin-specific compatibility details, known limitations, and migration guidance, see the [Detailed Compatibility Matrix](docs/Gradle9MigrationGuide.md#detailed-compatibility-matrix) in the Migration Guide.

### Adding the plugin to the build script

Within your Gradle build script, you need to set up the classpath to include the Liberty Gradle plugin. You also need to define the Maven Central repository to find the plugin and its dependencies.

If you are using a snapshot version of the plugin make sure to define the Sonatype Nexus Snapshots repository in addition to the Maven Central repository.

Your build script should look like this:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
            name = 'Central Portal Snapshots'
            url = 'https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/'
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.openliberty.tools:liberty-gradle-plugin:3.9.4'
    }
}
```

To use the Liberty Gradle Plugin, include the following code in your build script:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'liberty'
```

Alternatively, you can apply the plugin through the `plugins` block. You'll need to add the plugin's runtime dependencies to the buildscript classpath when using this method.

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        mavenLocal()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath ('io.openliberty.tools:liberty-ant-tasks:1.9.16')
        classpath ('io.openliberty.tools:ci.common:1.8.38')
    }
}

plugins {
    id "io.openliberty.tools.gradle.Liberty" version "3.9.4"
}
```

## Plugin Configuration

### Liberty Installation Configuration

The Liberty Gradle Plugin must first be configured with the Liberty server installation information. The installation information can be specified as:

* A [Maven artifact](docs/installLiberty.md#using-maven-artifact)
* An [existing installation directory](docs/libertyExtensions.md#general-runtime-properties) - reference the `installDir` property
* A Liberty server from a [Liberty repository or other location](docs/installLiberty.md#install-block)

Installing from a Maven artifact is the default installation method. The default runtime artifact is the latest version of `io.openliberty:openliberty-kernel`. 

Example using `libertyRuntime` property to install an Open Liberty beta runtime:

```groovy
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty.beta', name: 'openliberty-runtime', version: '25.0.0.7-beta'
}
```

Example using `libertyRuntime` property to install a specific Open Liberty runtime version:

```groovy
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'io.openliberty', name: 'openliberty-kernel', version: '25.0.0.6'
}
```

In order to configure WebSphere Liberty for installation, specify the `libertyRuntime` with the `com.ibm.websphere.appserver.runtime` group and the specific `name` and `version` that is needed. For a full list of artifacts available, see the [installLiberty task](docs/installLiberty.md#using-maven-artifact) documentation. 

Example using the `libertyRuntime` property to install a WebSphere Liberty runtime from a Maven artifact:

```groovy
dependencies {
    libertyRuntime group: 'com.ibm.websphere.appserver.runtime', name: 'wlp-webProfile8', version: '25.0.0.6'
}
```

### Additional Configuration

See the [Liberty extension properties](docs/libertyExtensions.md#liberty-extension-properties) reference for the properties used to configure the Liberty plugin. See each task for additional configuration and examples.

## Tasks

*The `libertyDev`, `libertyDevc`, and `generateFeatures` tasks have a runtime dependency on IBM WebSphere Application Server Migration Toolkit for Application Binaries, which is separately licensed under IBM License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs. For more information, see the [license](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/websphere/wasdev/license/wamt).
Note:  The `libertyDev` and `libertyDevc` tasks have this dependency only when auto-generation of features is turned on. By default, auto-generation of features is turned off.

### Task ordering

The Liberty Gradle plugin defines a built-in task order to allow a user to call an end task without worrying about calling the necessary tasks in between. By having the plugin manage tasks and their order of execution we can easily avoid some simple human errors. For example, in order to have a majority of the tasks function, the principal task `installLiberty` must be called, which our plugin would do for you.  

The most appealing benefit from defining a task order is the ability to allow the user to call an end task directly. For example, if the user calls `libertyStart` out of the box, Gradle will recognize that it must call `installLiberty -> libertyCreate -> installFeature -> deploy` to get a server with features and apps properly running.

## Extensions

Extensions are tasks that improve the compatibility or user experience of third party libraries used with Liberty. The `liberty-gradle-plugin` provides the following extensions:

| Extension | Description |
| --------- | ------------ |
| [configureArquillian](docs/configureArquillian.md) | Integrates `arquillian.xml` configuration for the Liberty Managed and Remote Arquillian containers in the `liberty-gradle-plugin`. Automatically configures required `arquillian.xml` parameters for the Liberty Managed container. |
| [Spring Boot Support](docs/spring-boot-support.md#spring-boot-support) | The Liberty Gradle Plugin supports thinning and installing Spring Boot applications onto the Liberty server. |
