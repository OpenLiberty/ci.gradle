* [Tasks](#tasks)
* [Properties](#extension-properties)

## Build

Clone this repository and then, with a JRE on the path, execute the following command in the root directory.

```bash
$ gradlew build
```

This will download Gradle and then build the plugin `liberty-gradle-plugin-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` in to the `build\libs` directory. It is also possible to install the plugin in to your local Maven repository using `gradlew install`.

To build the plugin and run the integration tests execute the following commands in the root directory.

1. To run the integration tests against an existing Liberty profile installation.
 ```bash
 $ gradlew build -Prunit=offline -DwlpInstallDir=<liberty_install_directory>
 ```
   
2. Run the integration tests against automatically downloaded and installed Liberty profile server.
 ```bash
 $ gradlew build -Prunit=online -DwlpLicense=<liberty_licesnse_code> -DwlpVersion=<liberty_version>
 ```

## Usage
### Configuring your dependencies

####  Adding the Ant plugin to the build script
This plugin needs the `wlp-anttasks.jar`file as a dependency, this file can be downloaded from the [snapshot repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/net/wasdev/wlp/ant/wlp-anttasks/) or the [Maven central repository](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/wasdev/wlp/ant/wlp-anttasks/).

The following code snippet shows an example for how to set up your build script correctly.
```groovy
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath files('gradle/wlp-anttasks.jar')
    }
}
```


### Adding the binary plugin to the build script

Within your Gradle build script, you need to set up the classpath to include the Liberty Gradle plugin. You also need to define the Maven Central repository to find the plugin or its dependencies. 

If you are using a snapshot version of the plugin make sure to define the Sonatype Nexus Snapshots repository in addition to the Maven Central repository.

Your build script should look like this:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven {
            name = 'Sonatype Nexus Snapshots'
            url = 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/'
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'net.wasdev.wlp.gradle.plugins:liberty-gradle-plugin:1.1-SNAPSHOT'
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you might choose to include the plugin JAR file. For example:

```groovy
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath files('gradle/liberty-gradle-plugin.jar')
        classpath files('gradle/wlp-anttasks.jar')
    }
}
```
To use the Liberty Gradle Plugin, include the following code in your build script:


```groovy
apply plugin: 'liberty'
```

## Tasks

The plugin will have made the following tasks available to your project:

| Task | Description |

| [cleanDir](#clean-task) | Deletes files from some directories in the WebSphere Liberty Profile server. |

## Extension properties
The Liberty Gradle Plugin has some properties defined in the `Liberty` closure which will let you customize the different tasks.
These properties are divided in two groups, the general properties (Which need to be set for any task excluding `installLiberty` task) and the specific ones. (Which only must be set when a specific task will be kicked off).

### General properties

| Attribute | Description | Required |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------|
| installDir | Location of the Liberty profile server installation. | Yes |
| outputDir |  Value of the `${wlp_output_dir}` variable. The default value is `${installDir}/usr/servers/${serverName}`.| No |
| userDir | Value of the `${wlp_user_dir}` variable. The default value is `${installDir}/usr/`. | No |
| serverName |Name of the Liberty profile server instance. The default value is `defaultServer`. | No |


### Server Task Properties

| Attribute | Description | Required |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------|
| clean | Clean all cached information on server start up. The default value is `false`. Only used with the `libertyStart` task. | No | 
| timeout | Waiting time before the server starts. The default value is 30 seconds. The unit is milliseconds. Only used with the `libertyStart` task. | No | 
| include | A comma-delimited list of values. The valid values vary depending on the task. For the `libertyPackage` task the valid values are `all`, `usr`, and `minify` and must be declared in the `packageLiberty` closure. For the `libertyDump` task the valid values are `heap`, `system`, and `thread` and must be declared in the `dumpLiberty` closure. For the `libertyJavaDump` task the valid values are `heap` and `system` and must be declared in the `javaDumpLiberty` closure. |  Yes, only when the `os` option is set in the `packageLiberty` closure|
| archive | Location of the target archive file. Only used with the `libertyPackage` or `libertyDump` tasks on their respective closures. | No |
| template | Name of the template to use when creating a new server. Only used with the `libertyCreate` task. | No |
| os| A comma-delimited list of operating systems that you want the packaged server to support. Only used with the `package` operation and in the `packageLiberty` closure. The 'include' option must be set to 'minify'. | No |

This example shows you how to configure these properties in your script:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'liberty'

liberty {
    installDir = 'c:/wlp'
    serverName = 'myServer'
    userDir = 'c:/usr'
    outputDir = 'c:/usr'
    clean = true
    timeout = "10000"

    packageLiberty {
        archive = "MyServerPackage.zip"
        include = "usr"
    }
    //Example to package with 'os' parameter
    packageLiberty {
        archive = "MyServerPackage.zip"
        include = "minify"
        os = "Linux"
    }
    dumpLiberty {
        archive = "C:/Dump.zip"
        include = "heap, system"
    }
    javaDumpLiberty {
        archive = "JavaDump.zip"
        include = "system"
    }
}

```

Of the plugin configuration, only the `installDir` property is required. The default configuration is to use a server named `defaultServer` under the `build\wlp` directory of the Gradle project.



## installLiberty task

The `install-liberty` task is used to download and install Liberty profile server. The task can download the Liberty runtime archive from a specified location (via `runtimeUrl`) or automatically resolve it from the [Liberty repository](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/) based on a version and a runtime type. 

In certain cases, the Liberty license code may need to be provided in order to install the runtime. If the license code is required and if you are installing Liberty from the Liberty repository, you can obtain the license code by reading the [current license](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/websphere/wasdev/downloads/wlp/16.0.0.2/lafiles/runtime/en.html) and looking for the `D/N: <license code>` line. Otherwise, download the runtime archive and execute `java -jar wlp*runtime.jar --viewLicenseInfo` command and look for the `D/N: <license code>` line.

### Properties

| Attribute | Description | Required |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------|
| licenseCode | Liberty profile license code. See [above](#install-liberty-task). | Yes, if `type` is `webProfile6` or `runtimeUrl` specifies a `.jar` file. |
| version | Exact or wildcard version of the Liberty profile server to install. Available versions are listed in the [index.yml](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/websphere/wasdev/downloads/wlp/index.yml) file. Only used if `runtimeUrl` is not set. By default, the latest stable release is used. | No |
| runtimeUrl | URL to the Liberty profile's `.jar` or a `.zip` file. If not set, the Liberty repository will be used to find the Liberty runtime archive. | No |
| baseDir | The base installation directory. The actual installation directory of Liberty profile will be `${baseDir}/wlp`. The default value is `${project.buildDir}`. | No | 
| cacheDir | The directory used for caching downloaded files such as the license or `.jar` files. The default value is `${java.io.tmpdir}/wlp-cache`. | No | 
| username | Username needed for basic authentication. | No | 
| password | Password needed for basic authentication. | No | 
| maxDownloadTime | Maximum time in seconds the download can take. The default value is `0` (no maximum time). | No | 
| type | Liberty runtime type to download from the Liberty repository. Currently, the following types are supported: `kernel`, `webProfile6`, `webProfile7`, and `javaee7`. Only used if `runtimeUrl` is not set. The default value is `webProfile6`. | No |

### Examples

1. Install using Liberty repository.
  ```groovy
    apply plugin: 'liberty'

    liberty {
        install {
            licenseCode = "<license code>"
        }
    }
  ```

2. Install from a specific location.
  ```groovy
    apply plugin: 'liberty'

    liberty {
        install {
            licenseCode = "<license code>"
            runtimeUrl = "<url to runtime.jar>"
        }
    }
  ```

3. Install Liberty runtime with all Java EE 7 features using Liberty repository.
  ```groovy
    apply plugin: 'liberty'

    liberty {
        install {
            type = "javaee7"
        }
    }
  ```

4. Install from a specific location using a zip file.
  ```groovy
    apply plugin: 'liberty'

    liberty {
        install {
            runtimeUrl="<url to wlp*.zip>"
        }
    }
  ```

## deploy task

The `deploy` task supports deployment of one or more applications to the Liberty Profile server.

### Properties

| Attribute | Description | Required |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------|
| file| Location of a single application to be deployed. The application type can be war, ear, rar, eba, zip, or jar. | Yes, only when a single file will be deployed. |
| dir|  Location of the directory where are the applications to be deployed.| Yes, only when multiples files will be deployed and `file` is not specified.|
| include| Comma- or space-separated list of patterns of files that must be included. All files are included when omitted.| No |
| exclude| Comma- or space-separated list of patterns of files that must be excluded. No files are excluded when omitted.| No |

Deploy's properties must be set up in the `deploy` closure inside the `liberty` closure.

### Examples

1. Deploys a single file.
  ```groovy
    apply plugin: 'liberty'

    liberty {
        installDir = 'c:/wlp'
        serverName = 'myServer'
        
        deploy {
            file = 'c:/files/app.war'
        }
    }
  ```

2. Deploy multiple files. Specifically, deploy `app.war` and `sample.war` but exclude `test-war.war`.
  ```groovy
    apply plugin: 'liberty'

    liberty { 
        installDir = 'c:/wlp'
        serverName = 'myServer'
        
        deploy {
            dir = 'c:/files'
            include = 'app.war, sample.war'
            exclude = 'test-war.war'
        }
    }
  ```

3. Deploy multiple files using multiple closures.
  ```groovy
    apply plugin: 'liberty'

    liberty { 
        installDir = 'c:/wlp'
        serverName = 'myServer'
        
        deploy {
            file = 'c:/files/app.war'
        }

        deploy {
            file = 'c:/resources/test.war'
        }
        
        deploy {
            dir = 'c:/extras'
            include = 'sample.war, demo.war'
        }
    }
  ```

The following examples shows you how to deploy a file using the `WAR` or the `EAR` Gradle plugins:

```groovy
    /* Deploys 'sample.war' using the WAR plugin */
    apply plugin: 'war'

    war {
        destinationDir = new File ('C:/files')
        archiveName = 'sample.war'
    }
```

`destinationDir` and `archiveName` are native properties of Gradle's WAR plugin. For more information see [here.](https://gradle.org/docs/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.War.html)

```groovy
    /* Deploys 'test.ear' using the EAR plugin */
    apply plugin: 'ear'

    ear {
        destinationDir = new File ('C:/files')
        archiveName = 'test.ear'
    }
```

`destinationDir` and `archiveName` are native properties of Gradle's EAR plugin. For more information see [here.](https://gradle.org/docs/current/dsl/org.gradle.plugins.ear.Ear.html)

## undeploy task

The `undeploy` task supports undeployment of one or more applications from the Liberty Profile server.

### Properties

| Attribute | Description | Required |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------|
| application| Name of the application to be undeployed.| Yes, only when a single application will be undeployed. |
| include| Comma- or space-separated list of patterns of files that must be included. All files are included when omitted.| No |
| exclude| Comma- or space-separated list of patterns of files that must be excluded. No files are excluded when omitted.| No |

Undeploy's properties must be set up in the `undeploy` closure inside the `liberty` closure.

### Examples

1. Undeploys a single application.
  ```groovy
    apply plugin: 'liberty'

    liberty {
        installDir = 'c:/wlp'
        serverName = 'myServer'
        
        undeploy {
            application = 'app.war'
        }
    }
  ```

2. Undeploy multiple applications. Specifically, undeploy `app.war` and `sample.war` but exclude `test-war.war`. 
  ```groovy
    apply plugin: 'liberty'

    liberty {
        
        installDir = 'c:/wlp'
        serverName = 'myServer'
        
        undeploy {
            include = 'app.war, sample.war'
            exclude = 'test-war.war'
        }
    }
  ```

If no property is set for the `undeploy` closure, but the EAR or WAR plugin is being used and their properties `destinationDir` and `archiveName` are declared, this will be the application that will be undeployed. Otherwise, all the applications available in the server at the moment of the execution will be undeployed.

## installFeature task
The `installFeature` task installs a feature packaged as a Subsystem Archive (ESA file) to the Liberty runtime.

### Properties

| Attribute | Description | Required |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------|
| featureName |Specifies the name of the Subsystem Archive (ESA file) to be installed. The value can be a feature name, a file name or a URL. | Yes |
| acceptLicense | Accept feature license terms and conditions. The default value is `false`.  | No |
| whenFileExists | Specifies the action to take if a file to be installed already exits. Use `fail` to abort the installation, `ignore` to continue the installation and ignore the file that exists, and `replace` to overwrite the existing file.| No |
| to | Specifies feature installation location. Set to `usr` to install as a user feature. Otherwise, set it to any configured product extension location. The default value is `usr`.| No |

### Examples

The following example shows what properties must be set up to install the [`mongodb-2.0`](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/#asset/features-com.ibm.websphere.appserver.mongodb-2.0) feature to your server:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'liberty'

liberty {
    installDir = "c:/wlp"

    features {
        name = ['mongodb-2.0']
        acceptLicense = true
    } 
}
```

Also is possible install multiple features in a single closure, for example:
```groovy
/* Install 'mongodb-2.0' and 'ejbLite-3.1' features using a single closure. */
apply plugin: 'liberty'

liberty {
    installDir = "c:/wlp"

    features {
        name = ['mongodb-2.0', 'ejbLite-3.1']
        acceptLicense = true
    } 
}
```
## uninstallFeature task
The `uninstallFeature` task uninstall a feature packaged as a Subsystem Archive (ESA file) to the Liberty runtime.

### Properties

| Attribute | Description | Required |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------|
| featureName |Specifies the name of the Subsystem Archive (ESA file) to be uninstalled. The value can be a feature name, a file name or a URL. | Yes |

### Examples

The following example shows what propertie will be uninstall the [`mongodb-2.0`](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/#asset/features-com.ibm.websphere.appserver.mongodb-2.0) 
Feature to your server:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'liberty'

liberty {
    installDir = "c:/wlp"

    uninstallfeatures {
        name = ['mongodb-2.0']
    } 
}
```
Also is possible uninstall multiple features in a single closure, for example:
```groovy
/* Uninstall 'mongodb-2.0', 'monitor-1.0' and 'oauth-2.0' features using a single closure. */
apply plugin: 'liberty'

liberty {
    installDir = "c:/wlp"

    uninstallfeatures {
        name = ['mongodb-2.0', 'monitor-1.0', 'oauth-2.0']
    } 
}
```
## clean task
The `clean` task deletes every file in the `${wlp_output_dir}/logs`, `${wlp_output_dir}/workarea`, `${wlp_user_dir}/dropins` or `${wlp_user_dir}/apps`.

### Properties

| Attribute | Description | Required |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------|
| logs |Delete all the files in the `${wlp_output_dir}/logs` directory. The default value is `true`. | No |
| workarea |Delete all the files in the `${wlp_output_dir}/workarea` directory. The default value is `true`. | No |
| dropins |Delete all the files in the `${wlp_user_dir}/dropins` directory. The default value is `false`. | No |
| apps |Delete all the files in the `${wlp_user_dir}/apps` directory. The default value is `false`. | No |

### Examples

The following example removes every app deployed to the `${userDir}/dropins` and every file in the `${wlp_output_dir}/workarea` and `${wlp_output_dir}/logs` directories: 

```groovy
apply plugin: 'liberty'

liberty {
    installDir = "c:/wlp"
    serverName = 'Server'

    cleanDir {
        dropins = true
    } 
}
```
Note: If you want to delete files from `${wlp_output_dir}/workarea` and `${wlp_output_dir}/logs` directories, the server needs to be stopped. 
```
